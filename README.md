# [UCLA Grade Distributions 2021-22](https://grades.natecation.xyz/)

This website displays [grade distribution data from Fall 2021, Winter 2022, Spring 2022, and Summer 2022](https://grades.natecation.xyz/), brought to you by [40+ UCLA students](https://grades.natecation.xyz/shoutouts).

This site is not affiliated with UCLA. Grade distribution data was sourced through a February 2023 [public records request](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l-R7LN9jOFUic3b4WTk4WxfDSjGNpuVw/view?usp=sharing) made under the California Public Records Act. [40+](https://grades.natecation.xyz/shoutouts) UCLA students [paid $131.25](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14LuoYaDCPUmts_6igA8rC3AVI2Ntyvqc/view?usp=sharing) to obtain these records.

UCLA students can download the data [on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14LuoYaDCPUmts_6igA8rC3AVI2Ntyvqc/view?usp=sharing) (log into your UCLA Google Account to access).
